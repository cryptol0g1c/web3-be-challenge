## Cryptologic web3/backend application challenge.

This is a sample application taking in account the requirements described at the end of the document.

Some not done features:
- The code coverage is not completed and not all use cases are covered
- ABIs are not stored in the database but in local files for now
- Errors management should be improved
- Needs to add verifications

### Installation
Step by step instullation explanation, or a quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the server application running.

Needs to create a .env file copying values from .env.example modifying values as desired.

It's needed a MongoDB instance running and to set the connection URL on MONGO_URL environment variable. 

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Run on docker 

You may modify Dockerfile to set environment variables properly and then execute the following commands:

```shell
docker build . -t mytag
docker run mytag
```

### Endpoints

- `POST` `/transaction` Stores the transaction information for the provided address. 
Body example:
```shell
{
    "tx": "0x508217c172c3cfe006ee9ca5bef621ba11a359461bacfc0494f1449a7d00f443"   
}
```
With header:
```shell
Content-Type: application/json
```
- `GET` `/transaction` Gets the information for the last saved transaction.
- `GET` `/contract/abi?tx=[contract address]` To download the ABI for the provided contract address.
- `GET` `/contract/bin` To download a sample contract binary.

Sample calls:
```shell
http://localhost:9650/transaction
http://localhost:9650/contract/bin
http://localhost:9650/contract/abi?hash=0x6e84a6216eA6dACC71eE8E6b0a5B7322EEbC0fDd
http://localhost:9650/contract/abi?hash=0x60aE616a2155Ee3d9A68541Ba4544862310933d4
http://localhost:9650/contract/abi?hash=0x454E67025631C065d3cFAD6d71E6892f74487a15

```

### Running tests
To run unit test and see test coverage you can run:

```
yarn test
```

#### Requirements.

The main goal of this challenge is to create a backend application writen in nodejs/typescript that consumes, processes and store blockchain data.

To achieve this, the following items are required.

- Create a fork of the current repository, once the challenge is done submit a proper PR.
- Instantiate a web3 o etherjs object with an public RPC (in this case we will use Avalanche EVM C-Chain)
- create a MongoDB database connection withing the runtime

Having this transaction as a starting point [0x508217c172c3cfe006ee9ca5bef621ba11a359461bacfc0494f1449a7d00f443](https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x508217c172c3cfe006ee9ca5bef621ba11a359461bacfc0494f1449a7d00f443) it is required to:

- Use web3.js or ethers.js proper methods to fetch transaction data details

- Fetch and save main contract ABI and bytecode and save them into a file and database

- Understand and parse the event log to show in a b√°sic REST response the decoded events and its parameters

- Create a basic REST endpoint that once queried saves the parsed data into a MongoDB document.

- Create a basic REST endpoint to get the previously saved data.


Must have:

- Basic error handling
- Basic README file
- Basic explaination of the work done

Extra points:
- unit testing
- Docker build
